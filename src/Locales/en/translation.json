My path bridges technical precision with human depth: engineering, marketing, and a restless curiosity for politics, ideas, and the social impact of technology. I build digital experiences that do more than function — they connect. Systems crafted to speak clearly to machines, and thoughtfully to people. In the technology industry, we build the future. And I believe that future should be intentional, transparent, and worth leaving behind. This portfolio is a glimpse into what I imagine, create, and question. Because building is also a way of understanding the world.",
